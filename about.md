Hey, I'm Peter Skaronis. Welcome to my online home!

## Writing
This site is my attempt to research, understand and synthesize concepts from many disciplines that interest me.
I focus on skill stacking and work on a new skill every month.
I start by researching the fundamentals for each topic, and then learn by getting hands-on until I understand it well enough to explain it and write about it.
My aim is to write essays, release guides for free and also have more in-depth research available for members.
I've been Vegan since 2012, and I've written a post "Why are you Vegan?" that explains my journey.
I also write "Neural Impulse",  a weekly newsletter about impulse ideas I have throughout the week. You can check out samples of the things you'll learn here.

## Career
I started learning about computers since I was 8 by building my first PC, using an Intel 286 processor. I've had different jobs in 4 different countries, but psychology, technology and Cybersecurity have been my passions.
I founded my own company, Techimpossible Security, a startup that helps businesses improve their understanding of Cybersecurity and use emerging technologies.

## Photography
I like landscape photography and enjoy taking a walk and capturing interesting frames. Furthermore, I publish my best shots on Unsplash.
My most famous photo so far.

## Favourite Quote
“If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings.”  ― Henry David Thoreau
